# Mnenomatics 

 Mnenomatics is a project used to train your mental calcul speed. 
 It can be used to train instantly remembering places by number in your memory palace, 
 remembering pictures or items in a memory table and more later. 


## How to 


### Install and Start 
 Automatic: 

 - Install the project with `./install.sh` command from this README directory. 
   install wil recreate the program if it already exists.
 - You can then start with `./start.sh` command in the same directory.

### Get help 
 Well you have to know how to use the program, so type `show help` in the basic command line. 
 This will display the basic usage and how to get further help.

### Show methods 
 You can type `list method` to list the methods available, then just write `show mental palace` 
 or any other method name to list it. 
 This will explain some basic memorization methods like memory palace with imaginary journeys, memory table. 
 Some methods for 11-20 numbers and 21-100 numbers multiplication, and maybe a method for simple number scare. 

### Play game 
 Input `list game` to list the games available, then `play multeasy` or any game name to play it. 
 The games are usualy training for memory or calcul, it will record the time you make to keep scores. 
 and maybe a progress status. 

## Technology 
 The source code will be in golang. I will try to use the golang packages whenever necessary. 
 Most of the user defined or program filled files will be csv, it is the same for non-writable definition files. 
 I will not use a database for now, but I think i'll use mariaDB or postgresql if a database is required later.
