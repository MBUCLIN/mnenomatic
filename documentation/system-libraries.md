# System Library 

 Some notes on system libraries use in the project 


## Index 
 - encoding/csv: I'll probably use CSV to import/export data from the program. 
 - math/rand: Random numbers are a big part of the math and memory games. 
 - others: Notice that I did not put errors/strings/os/io etc in because they are almost innevitable in the golang programming 
  (atleast I my level and use cases).
